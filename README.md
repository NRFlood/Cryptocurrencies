# Cryptocurrencies & Unserprvised Machine Learning

## Over of the analysis

This project was to help Martha research cryptocurrencies using unsupervised machine learning.  As part of the project we helped Martha write python code to process data, cluster the date, reduce the dimensions, as well as the principal components using PCA.  The result is a machine learning tool that will help our clients prepare to get into the cryptocurrency market.  The model allows us to generate a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they can be grouped to create a classification system the Accountability Accouting can use for this new investment.
